## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧾 **Receipts only** | Every claim in an answer is tagged `[R#]` (retrieved chunk) or `[T#]` (tool call). No tag, no claim — it gets flagged unverified instead. |
| 🧭 **Transparent routing** | `POST /v1/route` returns the routing decision and rationale without spending a generation call. |
| 🪤 **Adversarial eval set** | The golden set includes unanswerable questions and disguised tool-questions on purpose — not just easy wins. |
| 🔁 **Multi-hop chaining** | The router can sequence retrieval *then* a tool call for questions that need both. |
| 📊 **Living scorecard** | CI re-runs the eval set on every PR and updates a checked-in scorecard — the numbers are never stale. |
| 🔌 **OpenAI-compatible** | `/v1/chat/completions` with streaming, so existing clients point at Ledger unchanged. |

## The problem

Most RAG demos are built and judged on one happy-path question. They fall apart the moment a question can't be answered from the corpus, or secretly needs a live tool instead of a document, or needs both chained together. Ledger is built the other way around: the evaluation set — including the questions designed to break it — exists before most of the pipeline code does.

---

## How it works

```
==========================
USER QUERY
==========================

==========================
ROUTER
==========================
Decides: retrieve | call a tool | both, chained
Emits a routing rationale — inspectable via /v1/route

==========================
RETRIEVAL              TOOLS
==========================
Qdrant top-k search     Web search
+ cross-encoder rerank  Calculator / code exec

==========================
SYNTHESIS
==========================
Every sentence tagged with a receipt:
  [R3] retrieved chunk id 3
  [T1] tool call id 1
No receipt on a claim -> answer marked "unverified"
No receipt at all -> Ledger declines rather than invents

==========================
EVAL HARNESS
==========================
Golden set + adversarial traps
Retrieval recall@k · routing accuracy · faithfulness · citation coverage
```

## The one rule

Ledger has exactly one non-negotiable behavior, and everything else is built to serve it:

> **A claim without a receipt is not an answer.**

In practice:

- Every generated sentence carrying a fact is checked for a citation tag before it's returned.
- A question the corpus can't answer and no tool can resolve gets a plain refusal — never a confident guess.
- Routing decisions are never hidden inside a single opaque generation call; they're a separate, inspectable step.

---

## Eval harness

The eval set lives in `eval/golden_set.jsonl` as labeled cases across four categories:

| Category | What it tests |
|---|---|
| `retrieval` | Answerable directly from the corpus |
| `tool` | Needs a live tool (price, date, calculation) — not in the corpus at all |
| `multi_hop` | Needs retrieval *then* a tool, chained |
| `adversarial` | Deliberately unanswerable — the correct behavior is a refusal |

Each CI run reports:

- **Retrieval recall@k** — did the right chunk make it into the top k?
- **Routing accuracy** — did the router pick the category it should have?
- **Faithfulness** — does every claim's receipt actually support the claim (LLM-as-judge or `ragas`)?
- **Citation coverage** — % of factual sentences carrying a valid receipt tag

Results are written to `eval/scorecard.md` and committed by CI, so the README badge and the numbers in it stay honest.

## API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness check |
| `POST` | `/v1/route` | Routing decision + rationale, no generation |
| `POST` | `/v1/ask` | Full pipeline: route → retrieve/tools → synthesize |
| `POST` | `/v1/ask/receipts` | Same, with receipts returned as structured data separate from prose |
| `POST` | `/v1/documents` | Ingest a document into the vector store |
| `GET` | `/v1/tools` | List available tools |
| `POST` | `/v1/eval/run` | Run the golden set on demand, return a scorecard |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible, streaming supported |

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Qdrant** running locally (`docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant`)
- An OpenAI-compatible endpoint and key

### Install and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/behdadmehrnia/Ledger.git
cd Ledger
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # set LLM_API_KEY, QDRANT_URL

python -m scripts.fetch_corpus    # pull the PEP corpus
python -m scripts.ingest_corpus   # chunk, embed and index it

uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

No Qdrant server handy? Set `QDRANT_URL=":memory:"` to run the store in-process.
Embeddings are local either way — retrieval needs no API key, only synthesis does.

- Docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Health: `http://localhost:8000/health`

## Testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest                            # unit tests, no corpus or API key needed

python -m scripts.fetch_corpus
pytest -m corpus                  # every expected answer checked against real PEP text
pytest -m retrieval               # end-to-end retrieval, downloads ONNX models once

python -m eval.run_golden_set     # eval harness
```

The harness picks the richest mode the environment supports and writes
`eval/scorecard.md`:

| Mode | Needs | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| `routing` | nothing | routing, tool selection |
| `retrieval` | the corpus on disk | the above, plus recall@k before and after reranking |
| `full` | `LLM_API_KEY` | the above, plus citation coverage and faithfulness |

Embeddings run locally, so CI reaches `retrieval` mode with no secrets — the
retrieval numbers are produced on every pull request, not just on `main`.

---

## Tech stack

- **FastAPI** + **Uvicorn** — HTTP surface, OpenAPI docs
- **Qdrant** — vector store, with an in-process mode for tests and CI
- **fastembed** — local ONNX embeddings and cross-encoder reranking: no API key,
  no torch, so CI can grade retrieval on every pull request
- **Pydantic v2** — schemas and configuration
- **pytest** + **ragas** (or an LLM-judge script) — testing and faithfulness scoring
- **Docker** — packaging

Retrieval is written directly against `qdrant-client` rather than through an
orchestration framework. Receipts depend on an exact chunk-to-citation-tag
mapping, and owning that code outright is simpler than configuring a framework
to preserve it.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 0** — Pick a corpus (Python PEPs), write ~30 golden questions (including adversarial traps) before any pipeline code
- [ ] **Phase 1** — Retrieval-only MVP: ingest, embed, search, rerank, cited answers; baseline recall@k
- [ ] **Phase 2** — Add the agent + router with two tools (web search, calculator/code-exec)
- [ ] **Phase 3** — Receipts and refusal logic; pass the adversarial set
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Multi-hop chaining (retrieval → tool in sequence)
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Docker, CI eval job, scorecard badge, optional live demo

---

## Design goals

- **Evaluation before generation** — the golden set exists before the pipeline does
- **Refuse rather than invent** — an honest refusal beats a confident fabrication
- **Inspectable, not a black box** — routing and receipts are always visible on request
- **Receipts as a first-class citizen** — not a nice-to-have layered on afterward
